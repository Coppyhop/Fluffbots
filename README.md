A completly modular bot System for discord. This allows users to create and share modules, and let otherwise inexperienced people create their own bot for discord.

In the same directory, make 2 files and a folder. Modules.txt, config.properties, and the folder is named "modules". In the config add a line "token=" and paste in your bot token. Then add a line "version=" and type what you want your bot playing. Save and exit. Add any modules you want into the modules folder and append their class names to modules.txt. Double click on the jar and your bot should start up.
