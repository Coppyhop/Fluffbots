# Fluffbots

A project with the goal of creating discord bots that have personalities, 
and act human.

Setting up:

Currently the program requires 2 bot tokens, In the next release you'll be able to choose if the second bot is enabled.
Token 1 is the main bot, and Token 2 is the "Bartender" the second bot is geared more towards Role-playing.

In the file "config.properties" you'll find spaces to add in your tokens. After that, build a jar (MAKE SURE YOU HAVE JDA IN YOUR CLASSPATH)
Then just run the jar, more configuration options coming soon.
